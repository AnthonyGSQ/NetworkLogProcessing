= Hotel Reservation System

A high-performance, multi-threaded C++ server for processing and storing hotel room reservations with scalable concurrent architecture and PostgreSQL database integration.

==  Project Overview

This is a **professional-grade hotel reservation system** built in C++20 that demonstrates enterprise software development practices. Clients submit reservation requests via HTTP, which are validated, processed concurrently, and persisted in a PostgreSQL database.

=== Core Capabilities

* **Accept concurrent reservations** from multiple clients simultaneously
* **Process requests** using a thread pool for scalable concurrency
* **Validate data** comprehensively (dates, prices, guest info)
* **Store reservations** persistently in PostgreSQL
* **Manage lifecycle** with graceful shutdown and signal handling
