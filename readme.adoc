= Network Log Processing

A high-performance C++ application for collecting, processing, and analyzing HTTP network logs with PostgreSQL storage and statistical reporting capabilities.

== Overview

This application provides a robust solution for network log management by:

* Receiving HTTP-formatted log messages from the network
* Validating and processing incoming log data
* Storing structured logs in a PostgreSQL database
* Generating comprehensive statistics and insights from collected data

== Features

* *Real-time HTTP Log Processing*: Handles HTTP-formatted network messages
* *Data Validation*: Ensures log integrity before storage
* *PostgreSQL Integration*: Efficient database storage and retrieval
* *Statistical Analysis*: Generate reports and insights from stored logs
* *Scalable Architecture*: Designed for high-volume log processing

== Requirements

* C++17 or higher
* PostgreSQL 12+
* Google Test (for testing)
* Make

== Building the Project

[source,bash]
----
make all
----

== Running Tests

[source,bash]
----
make test
----

This command will run all the google test of the *tests* directory

== Merge minimum requirements

[source, bash]
----
make coverage
----

This will run all the google test, see if they coverage at least 90% of all the code and check if there is any memory leak using valgrind.

== Usage

[source,bash]
----
# Start the log processor
./bin/network_log_processor

# View available options
./bin/network_log_processor --help
----

== HTTP Log Format

The application expects HTTP-formatted messages with the following structure:

[source,http]
----
POST /log HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Length: <length>

{
  "timestamp": "2025-12-25T10:30:00Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "message": "Log message here",
  "source": "192.168.1.100"
}
----

== Database Schema

The PostgreSQL database stores logs with the following schema:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE TABLE logs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    level VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    source VARCHAR(50),
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
----

== Configuration

Database connection settings can be configured via environment variables:

[source,bash]
----
export DB_HOST=localhost
export DB_PORT=5432
export DB_NAME=network_logs
export DB_USER=postgres
export DB_PASSWORD=your_password
----
